My purpose of writing this blog is to help me achieve my goal, which is to have finished a draft of my PhD thesis in Computer Science. I will aim to have it finished in 42 days, starting today on July 7th 2023.

In this post, I will reflect on the goal that I have set. What I write below is inspired by Locke's Goal-Setting Theory, as described on the [MindTools website](https://www.mindtools.com/azazlu3/lockes-goal-setting-theory).

The website recommends goals to be set to be SMART: Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-bound.

My specific goal is

1. Clarity.
2. Challenge.
3. Commitment.
4. Feedback.
5. Task complexity.


**1. Clarity**

- Write your goal down and be as detailed as possible. Use SMART, and consider putting your goal into the form of a personal mission statement for added clarity.
- Think about how you'll measure your success toward this goal. What specific metrics will you use?
- Once you've set your goal, examine how it makes you feel. Are you excited? Does the challenge motivate you? If you don't feel strongly about the goal, you might need to clarify it or change it entirely.




**2. Challenge**

- Look at your goal. Is it challenging enough to spark your interest?
- Develop self-discipline, so that you have the persistence to work through problems.
- Identify ways that you can reward yourself when you make progress. Incremental rewards for reaching specific milestones will motivate you to work through challenging tasks.
- Before taking on a major goal, research it thoroughly. This will help you be realistic.


**3. Commitment**

- Stay committed by using visualization techniques to imagine how your life will look once you've achieved your goal.
- Create a treasure map to remind yourself why you should work hard. Visual representations of your goal can help you stay committed, even when the going gets tough.


**4. Feedback**

- Schedule time once a week to analyze your progress and accomplishments. Look at what has and hasn't worked, and make adjustments along the way.
- Learn how to ask for feedback on your progress from others.
- Use technology to track and measure your progress. Apps like Lift are a good place to start.
- Measure progress by breaking difficult or large goals down into smaller chunks, and seek feedback when you reach each milestone.



**5. Task complexity**

- Give yourself plenty of time to accomplish complex goals. Set deadlines that apply an appropriate amount of pressure, while still being achievable.
- If you start to feel stressed about meeting your goals, they might be too complex or unrealistic. Reassess both of these areas and modify your goals if necessary.
- Break large, complex goals down into smaller sub-goals. This will stop you feeling overwhelmed, and it will make it easier to stay motivated.

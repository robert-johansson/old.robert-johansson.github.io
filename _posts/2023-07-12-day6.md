Today has been an important day. After my meeting with Nils Dahlb√§ck earlier today, I feel like I'm on the right track. I have worked mainly with the chapter on Generalized Identity Matching (according to the plan), but have also touched the chapter on Arbitrarily Applicable Relational Responding (AARR; Chapter 6). In the AARR chapter, I know that there is one problem I need to solve - how to explain transformation of functions completely. It relates to the problem of functional equivalence that I was touching on yesterday.

I feel good about the progress that I have made today, and have lots of energy to keep working tomorrow.

## Notes to self

## Mid-day notes

Today around lunchtime I had a meeting with Nils Dahlbäck, one of my supervisors on my thesis. We had a very good discussion, and he helped me clear up several things. Given that the whole purpose of this 42 day project is to use those time constraints as a means for making decisions that can be hard, he very much helped me doing so. A few examples of decisions made as of today:

- The purpose of my thesis is to investigate the learning abilities of NARS, seen from a learning psychology perspective
- This means that I will not use this thesis to push forward learning psychology as an AGI theory
- Almost the first sentence of the thesis can be a statement, that I have conducted empirical studies from an operant point of view. That is, rather than seeing humans as information processing systems, I see an information processing system (NARS) as an organism in the sense that it can be studied from an operant point of view
- The thesis can be seen as having two parts - the first one (Chapters 3 and 4) being empirical studies where no changes are made to the NARS system, and the second one (Chapters 5 and 6) are about changes made to NARS inspired by the perspective taken.

I feel very positive about these changes, as it will affect the whole thesis. I will use the day to write from this new perspective.

Today I realized that my thesis definitely has two parts: One is Machine Psychology in that it investigates the operant learning abilities of NARS up to and including generalized identity matching. The other part is about extending OpenNARS for Applications with new functionality - which I would say is closer to typical research in computer science.

A key decision that was made today is to write the entire thesis first, as if it only contained the first part. This is trick to help me avoid difficult decisions early on in the writing.

Furthermore, I spent lots of time today of finding a good framework to explain Learning Psychology. I have settled on following the excellent free online book [Behaviour Analysis: A primer (2020)](https://www.behaviouranalysis.eu.com), by Mickey Keenan and Karola Dillenburger.

I was also out running for about 7.5 km. This is indeed very important to keep up with.

The decision made about has made the number of total pages go down!

Total number of pages written since July 7th: **2**

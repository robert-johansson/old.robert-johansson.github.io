Here is an update of my journey this far. Starting with this project was very difficult. One main difficulty has been to draw the necessary boundaries for my work. Up until this point I have struggled with finding a way to express the whole idea with the thesis project. I have worked a bit on the Stimulus Equivalence chapter, but got stuck when I saw what a depth I was touching on, in investigating the differences between functional equivalence and stimulus equivalence.

On a more personal level, I realized the importance of physical and mental health care during this process. I was out running for about 5 km, and was amazed how much energy I got from that. Also, I have kept meditating, which has kept being a very rewarding activity.

## Notes to self
- Remember to do physical exercise throughout the 42 days
- Remember to prioritize my meditation practice
